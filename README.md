## History

Perry White is based on several projects.

* The base editor is [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net).
* [CZI-Prosemirror](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/czi-prosemirror) built on top of that and added React rendering
* That was extended further by the [Licit Editor](https://github.com/MO-Movia/licit)
* This fork converts from flow to Typescript, adds a few plugins and removes several that were not wanted
